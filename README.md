# Hack_Rice_X_Project
Repo for Hack Rice X

The dataset was primarily based on 720p/1080p lecture videos of college open courses. From each video, we selected excerpts with clear view of the chalkboard. Frames were extracted based on 15-second intervals and exported as .png files. A total of 4,000 png files made up the output of dataset. The input was made by subsampling the 4000 png files by a factor of 2. 3600 pairs were randomly selected as the training set and the remaining 400 were used as the validation set.
